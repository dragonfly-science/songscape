#Andre has destroyed the old remote songscape_dev database after I stuffed it up after manually dropping tables
#Only the new server address has changed (each user should note this down for future access)

###Checking new remote server###
#Changed just the server address in the tunnel making commands and it works! 
#Remote songscape_dev currently empty, will rebuild schema after testing out locally

###Creating local songscape_dev database###
#In postgres:
CREATE DATABASE songscape_dev;
CREATE USER jasonhideki password 'Takahashi2';
#In settings.py and local_settings.py, changed USER to 'jasonhideki', PASSWORD to 'Takahashi2', HOST to 'localhost', and PORT to ''
#Also generated a separate SECRET_KEY for the local server and commented out the remote server one
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py migrate
#NOTE: both the above commands printed:
Error loading local settings #indicating that the command couldn't locate local_settings.py but the command still seemed to run properly to construct all the database tables
#TODO: check if Victor gets the same local settings error when he runs it without all my changes (don't commit till then)
python manage.py initial

###Modifying fixtures csv's###
#Had to modify dates to DD/MM/YY format for commands to run properly
#Had to add leading 0's to make sites 4 digits, recorders 6 digits in all fixtures for load_recordings to work properly
NOTE: running load_recording.py generates songscape_load_recordings.log which is useful for debugging
TODO:add the 9 Zealandia site deployments

#Tried and failed with Victor to finish script for extracting 5 random snippets from each recording

Feb 29, 2016
#Got extract_5_snippets script to successfully print 5 random snippets!
#Deleted superfluous extract_5_snippet script attempts
#Added a recorder number 000000 to recorders.csv and added 000000 deployments for each site in deployments.csv
#Flushed database and reloaded tables with initial.py and load_recordings.py
#In extract_5_snippets.py changed selection criteria for Recordings.get from md5=md5 to path=path (line 49)
#Ran extract_5_snippetys.py
#Get error after 168 snippets:
File "/home/jasonhideki/songscape/www/recordings/management/commands/extract_5_snippets.py", line 44, in handle
    offset = float(row[1])
IndexError: list index out of range
TODO: fix error so that extract_5_snippets generates all the snippets
