#Andre has destroyed the old remote songscape_dev database after I stuffed it up after manually dropping tables
#Only the new server address has changed (each user should note this down for future access)

###Checking new remote server###
#Changed just the server address in the tunnel making commands and it works! 
#Remote songscape_dev currently empty, will rebuild schema after testing out locally

###Creating local songscape_dev database###
#In postgres:
CREATE DATABASE songscape_dev;
CREATE USER jasonhideki password 'Takahashi2';
#In settings.py and local_settings.py, changed USER to 'jasonhideki', PASSWORD to 'Takahashi2', HOST to 'localhost', and PORT to ''
#Also generated a separate SECRET_KEY for the local server and commented out the remote server one
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py migrate
#NOTE: both the above commands printed:
Error loading local settings #indicating that the command couldn't locate local_settings.py but the command still seemed to run properly to construct all the database tables
#TODO: check if Victor gets the same local settings error when he runs it without all my changes (don't commit till then)
python manage.py initial

###Modifying fixtures csv's###
#Had to modify dates to DD/MM/YY format for commands to run properly
#Had to add leading 0's to make sites 4 digits, recorders 6 digits in all fixtures for load_recordings to work properly
NOTE: running load_recording.py generates songscape_load_recordings.log which is useful for debugging
TODO:add the 9 Zealandia site deployments

#Tried and failed with Victor to finish script for extracting 5 random snippets from each recording

Feb 29, 2016
#Got extract_5_snippets script to successfully print 5 random snippets!
#Deleted superfluous extract_5_snippet script attempts
#Added a recorder number 000000 to recorders.csv and added 000000 deployments for each site in deployments.csv
#Flushed database and reloaded tables with initial.py and load_recordings.py
#In extract_5_snippets.py changed selection criteria for Recordings.get from md5=md5 to path=path (line 49)
#Ran extract_5_snippetys.py
#Get error after 168 snippets:
File "/home/jasonhideki/songscape/www/recordings/management/commands/extract_5_snippets.py", line 44, in handle
    offset = float(row[1])
IndexError: list index out of range
TODO: fix error so that extract_5_snippets generates all the snippets

#Nirosha's noise removal script warped some sounds to make them more difficut to recognise 
#so I reloaded the database removing the 000000 recordings from the database and undid lines written to deal with 000000 recordings
#also in extract_5_snippets.py changed selection criteria for Recordings.get from path=path back to md5=md5 (line 49)
#was still getting error after 168 snippets mentioned Feb 29, 2016
#error went away and all snippets were generated when I had extract_5_snippets only create the output.csv 
#and had extract_snippets read output.csv to generate the snippets
#renamed extract_5_snippets select_5_snippets

Mar 3, 2016
#had to adjust select_5_snippets to have two cases for random_number = random.randrange(), one for when i is 0 and one for all others
#because math would be different with 0 and was resulting in some recordings have 6 snippets and some 4 previously
#manually added in a header line to outputs.csv because extract_snippets was producing 1 less snippet than the total and that fixed it
TODO: make it so I don't have to manually enter outputs.csv's header
NOTE: currently no detectors in database because score_snippets.py is what loads them and I didn't use that command for weather test
#ended work at this error running select_snippets_for_weather_analysis:
ValueError: Cannot assign "('VICU-0220-2015-04-04T07:39:58Z-1020-60',)": "AnalysisSet.snippet" must be a "Snippet" instance.

#going to try creating a list of snippets matching those in output.csv using filters so that the snippets remain instances of Snippet #of Snippet (in models) with all their fields
#select_snippets_for_weather_analysis seemed to work after commenting out bit about zip(snippets), I guess not needed as there aren't #multiple lists of snippets as in the original select_snippets_for_analysis
#195 snippets now in analysisset as they should be
#ran:
python manage.py sonograms
#successfully generated 195 sonograms without any modifications to sonograms.py
#ran:
python manage.py runserver
#navigating to analysis button fails because its set up to go to an analysis named rimutaka-kiwi but going to 
#the server address /analysis lets you select 'slug' and then takes you to the weather test
#created 3 tags for weather test: clear, noisy, and too_noisy
#changed settings and local_settings to reflect remote database settings: 'USER' = 'birdsong' and 'PORT' = '5000' and password as per #andre's email
#remote link worked, now to set up database:
python manage.py syncdb
#created django superuser jasonhideki, Takahashi2, jhiikun@gmail.com
python manage.py migrate
QUESTION: why do I always get error loading local settings when I run songscape commands?
python manage.py initial
python manage.py load_recordings
NOTE: load_recordings took a long time to run (just let it run and it was successful)
In remote postgres songscape_dev:
\copy recordings_analysis from '/home/jasonhideki/songscape/analysis.csv' DELIMITERS ',' CSV;
NOTE: COPY command didn't work here because not superuser but anyone can use \copy
back in regular terminal command line:
python manage.py select_snippets_for_weather_analysis
python manage.py runserver
#it worked!!
#created clear, noisy, too_noisy tags and added to weather analysis
#analysed a few snippets in weather analysis just to make sure it works
